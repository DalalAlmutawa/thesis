# Thesis

This project uses the EEGLAB and Neural Networks Toolboxes in MATLAB (2014b) in order to distinguish between Left and Right hand movements based on EEG. 

-----

## Toolboxes
* [EEGLAB](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/EEGLAB_revision_history_version_13) - Toolbox for working with EEG currently using 13.4.4b
* [EEGLAB extensions/plugins](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/EEGLAB_Extensions) - List of extensions (formerly called plugins) that can be used with EEGLAB. The following are needed to run program
	* [AAR (Automatic Artifact Removal)](https://github.com/germangh/eeglab_plugin_aar) - Toolbox used for EOG and EMG removal
	* [BioSig](http://biosig.sourceforge.net) - For importing EDF files, which is how the files are saved on Physionet

-----

## Data
All EEG data used in this project is from [Physionet](http://physionet.org/pn4/eegmmidb/) which can be viewed online at the [PhysioBank ATM](http://physionet.org/cgi-bin/atm/ATM).
