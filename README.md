# Thesis

This is the the project I am working on for my Masters in Computer Engineering

This project uses the EEGLAB and Neural Networks Toolboxes in MATLAB (2014b) in order to distinguish between Left and Right hand movements based on EEG.

## Toolboxes
* [EEGLAB](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/EEGLAB_revision_history_version_13) - Toolbox for working with EEG currently using 13.4.4b
* [BCILAB toolbox](https://github.com/sccn/BCILAB) - Allows for the modification and analysis of the EDF files
* [EEGLAB extensions/plugins](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/EEGLAB_Extensions) - List of extensions (formerly called plugins) that can be used with EEGLAB
	* [AAR (Automatic Artifact Removal)](https://github.com/germangh/eeglab_plugin_aar) - Toolbox used for EOG and EMG removal
	* [BioSig](http://biosig.sourceforge.net) - For importing EDF files, which is how the files are saved on Physionet

## Data
All EEG data used in this project is from [Physionet](http://physionet.org/pn4/eegmmidb/) which can be viewed online at the [PhysioBank ATM](http://physionet.org/cgi-bin/atm/ATM).
