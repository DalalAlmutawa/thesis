# Thesis

This is the the project I am working on for my Masters in Computer Engineering

This project uses the BCILAB and Neural Networks Toolboxes in MATLAB in order to distinguish between Left and Right hand movements based on EEG.

These files require the [BCILAB](https://github.com/sccn/BCILAB) to be downloaded
